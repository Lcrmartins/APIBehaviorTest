# API Behavior Test
## This project has the purpose of test the Sweeters app.

I built this console project to test the behavior of the API. By sending controlled search strings into the API Url and testing the returning data.

The project APIBehaviorTest sends 7 search strings using a for statement trying to simulate simultaneous requests. I received the task to do in 4 days but I coudnt find the bug that crash the functioning.

I couldn't manage to put this project inside the Sweeters without inserting bug into it. Lack of knowledge.

I didn't try to make a new repository for it because the restrictions. So I put it in the same repository of Sweeters.
